To-do:

//Look into adding icons for things like coins
1) Simplify UI text (words and icons)

//Look into this...
2) Level number on side of sprite?

//AI checks for new target every TimeBetweenRecheckTarget seconds now
3) AI can target king far away and not redirect after spawns

//updated values and increased interval between special effects (13 -> 18)
4) Effects don't feel good, positive too weak and negative too harsh (maybe random area)

//upped alpha value from 128 to 192
5) Special effect text more readable/visible

//time between sp coin generation 1 sec -> 0.7 sec (won a game by spamming level 5 knights lol)
6) SP: better balance (more coins maybe)

//not really a bug because king just gets one shot, should be fine without fix
7) King last defense called when one shot (move last defense if not dead after damage)
